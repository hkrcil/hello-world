# hello-world
a place for ideas, a sandbox to play

My name is Heidi. I am a nurse by background and graduated with a computer science degree in 2004. I have worked in the Healthcare Information Technology sector since 2005. My dual backgound has been very helpful, but I do miss coding a bit. So I am here to play and brush the dust of my coding skills. :)
